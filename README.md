> This project is a Node.js API service designed for the collection, processing, and storage of agricultural data related to durian farming. It integrates with multiple external APIs to fetch up-to-date information and stores the processed results in a MySQL database. The system is modular, with each domain (such as crops, farmers, operations, substance usage, water usage, merchants, news, and durian gardens) handled by its own set of controllers, services, and processors.
